# TERRAFORM - EC2 - ANSIBLE
This example shows how to:
- create a simple infrastructure with 2 or more ec2 instances using Terraform;
- to scale nodes count;
- provision smth on the nodes (copy, create, install);
- use and work with Ansible to configure nodes;
- upload your page with simple html code to the Apache server on all nodes with
different content.
- run Classic Elastic Load Balancer on AWS by Terraform

If you want to use this repo on your own, you have to change keys to yours to
access to the nodes.
